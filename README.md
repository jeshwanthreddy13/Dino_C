# Dino_C
This is a game made with C.
In this project there are five .c files and 2 header files.
This is a basic dinosaur jumping over obstacles type game with basic graphics.
There are two obstacles, cactus and a donkey that appear in random order and our job is to jump over them and keep scoring as many points as possible.

 I have used the ncurses library to accomplish most of the stuff that happens in this project.
 
 HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT :-
 Use the MAKEfile I have provided to run the files.
 When you run the program press r on your keyboard to start the game.
 Press Spacebar to jump over obstacles and score points.
 The speed of the obstacle increases as you score more points.
 
 Enjoy!
