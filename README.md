 I have used the ncurses library to accomplish most of the stuff that happens in this project.
 I have commented after every line in most of the files to make the peices of codes more understandable and logically sound.
 
 HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT :-
 Use the MAKEfile I have provided to run the files.
 When you run the program press r on your keyboard to start the game.
 Press Spacebar to jump over obstacles and score points.
 The speed of the obstacles increase as you score more points.
 
 Enjoy !
