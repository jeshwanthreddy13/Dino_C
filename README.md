# Dino_C
This is a game made with only C.
 In this project there are five .c files that make this game a whole and 2 header files.
 This is a basic dinosaur jumping over obstacles type game with basic graphics. 
 I have used the ncurses library to accomplish most of the stuff that happens in this project and used most of the functions again and again in order to make it short and compact.
 I have commented after every line in most of the files to make the peices of codes more understandable and logically sound.
 
 HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT :-
 Use the MAKEfile I have provided to run the files.
 When you run the program press r on your keyboard to start the game.
 Press Spacebar to jump over obstacles and score points.
 The speed of the obstacles increases as you score more points.
 
 Enjoy !
